			PALO ALTO
			
			I got some words in my throat but not much to say. Have got years before those words come
			from my chest and yet they roll off my tongue, too lightly spoken for their own good. Fools
			words; empty promises and easy on the ears. How many times do I have to lie to believe it on
			the inside. I don’t lie to you; I lie to myself and bolder than you’d ever believe. Drag the
			words through the mud, suck off the dirt and spit them out again. A storyteller by any other
			name whereby a paucity of information is stretched to fill a tale as far as the eye can see. Let
			me lie to you, fill your ears with them, can you feel my hot breath as I whisper sweet
			nothings and seal them with a passionate kiss of plausibility? A woman of two tongues;
			deciphering words of reason or rhyme is a riddle best left for the confessional when the
			echoing silence gives you the answer that had been ringing in your ears long before you had
			reached the silence that could have delivered it to you. Alone. You’re on your own there,
			you’re on your own. The words on your lips purge the answer that had been sitting in your
			gut, an accumulation of fools words you’d swallowed, how sweet they had tasted on the
			tongue. How ill you felt now they sit stiff, a pile of pyrite that had blinded you with its gleam.
			Can you confess, do you have the guts to carry on knowing it was never like this? Was it all
			you dreamed of? You had it all, we all know that, but now you’re standing there with nothing
			much more than the carve of a woman living under a shell. A shell of lies is shadowed by
			your cloud of misbelief, a head fog that won’t leave you alone. Can you take much more of
			this or are you too hiding, hiding under that shadow? You’re so desperate now you’d split
			your tongue to know that at least you won’t be alone wherever you go. Two tongues of
			tempered tales are better than one taste of bitter reality. It seems easier than to feel what it is
			to know that it was all a siren song so you could give up your ‘some’ to become ‘one’.
			You’re afraid you can’t make it through what’s next, a coward in the shadows of neglected
			corners, unable to look at your ulceric love. If you focus on the good the good is meant to get
			better but what’s one to do when the good isn’t so great after all.</p></div>

				<h2>Fashion as self-expression</h2>
				<p class="description">Caring about clothes can sometimes be seen as frivolous and superficial. And yet, when it comes to other forms of self-expression, such as painting, writing or dancing, it's readily accepted that the more you care, the more likely you are to fall into a path of personal exploration.</p>
